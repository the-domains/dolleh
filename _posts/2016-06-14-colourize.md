Colourize \#1

**The world's top colours:**

According to various international studies, the world's most popular color is blue. Based on the survey conducted by several global marketing firms, they've concluded that people worldwide picked blue (40%) as their favorite color followed by purple (14%). Though some researchers also suggest that red and green are a close second and third respectively. White, orange, and yellow are some of the least favorite colors.

**The first colour a child sees after being born:**

Recent studies have shown that infants as young as 2 weeks of age can already distinguish the color red. Probably because red has the longest wavelength among colors making it the easiest color to process by the developing receptors and nerves in the eyes.

**Calm down Mate!**

Pink is a peaceful color... Apparently, it suppresses anger and anxiety due to its calming effect. That is why prisons and mental health care institutions painted their walls pink to control the behavior of those out-of-control prisoners and patients. The first tests were conducted with orange, which seemed to have no positive effect to inmates.
